## A brief introduction to eigen-decomposition

Eigen-decomposition of a matrix is simply the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that matrix. A types of matrices used often in statistics are called *positive semi-definite*. These matrices always have eigen-decomposition in a convenient form. Formally, a matrix a is positive semi-definite if it can be obtained as
