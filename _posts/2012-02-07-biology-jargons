#Bio-Jargon

After reading my fair share of biology papers for the past three years, I've come to realize that, like most fields, biology is full of jargons. However, unlike quantitive fields such as math and physics, biology papers are usually written in a more accessible manner. Equipped with a thorough understanding of some common jargons, I believe most undergraduate science student can fully comprehend biological research papers. So after three years, I've decided to compile my own list and explanation so other students are not so easily dissuaded from pursuing a thorough understanding of any paper they encounter.

The list will be divided into multiple categories based on my own opinion of where they are most relevant. (Note: this is a work in progress, all explanations are subject to change)

### Genetics
- **GAL4**: a genetic tool that allow for the manipulation of the activity of uniquely identified cells
    - a transcriptional activator from budding yeast
    - part of the popular GAL4/UAS binary expression system: one transgenic construct drives the expression of the GAL4 and another construct contains its binding site positioned upstream of a responder gene
    - depending on the **driver** (promoter driving GAL4), the responder gene can be made to express in specific cells
- **Genetic screen**:

What does the letters and numbers of a transgenic strain mean?

- GMRgal4>UAS-XYZ
    - *GMR* represents the promoter sequence driving the expression of GAL4
    - *gal4>UAS* represents the expression system being used
    - *XYZ* is the protein of interest that it ultimately being expressed
